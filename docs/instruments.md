# `instrument()`

Sound generation is managed by instrument objects. In general, we can access
these by using one of the names defined in the JS module, like `piano`,
`organ`, `synth`, etc. These are constants provided by litePlay.js, allowing an
easy selection of sound generators (to fulfill the _onSomething_ attribute of
an event).

This is the complete set of instruments available in litePlay. There are 128
different instruments plus six special drum kits that can be accessed via their 
name or their individual numbers.
